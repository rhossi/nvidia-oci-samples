## Description

This repository maintains sample applications designed for NVIDIA software tools integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

For select demonstrations, the sample code is contained within this repository. For others, we reference and link to exceptional demonstrations available outside of this repository.

## Support Level

These samples are provided as community examples and are not covered by NVIDIA Enterprise Support. They are intended as reference implementations to help users get started with NVIDIA software on OCI. See [SUPPORT](#support) below for how to get help.

## Requirements

- An active [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) account with permissions to create the resources used by a given sample
- Access to NVIDIA GPU shapes in your target OCI region (e.g., A10, A100, H100, H200)
- The OCI CLI installed and configured, or access to the OCI Console
- Additional, sample-specific prerequisites are documented in each sample's own README

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-oci-samples.git
   cd nvidia-oci-samples
   ```
2. Browse the [Samples](#samples) section below and pick the one that matches your use case.
3. Follow the README inside that sample's directory for setup and run instructions.

## Samples

Samples are organized by OCI service:

- [`oke-samples/`](./oke-samples) — Samples that run on [Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/container-engine-kubernetes/).
  - `aiq-2.0/` — NVIDIA AIQ 2.0 on OKE *(coming soon)*
- [`generative-ai-samples/`](./generative-ai-samples) — Samples for NVIDIA generative AI workflows on OCI.
  - [`agentic-multimodal-expense-intelligence/`](./generative-ai-samples/agentic-multimodal-expense-intelligence/) — Nemotron Parse + Omni receipt intelligence with NemoClaw-style governance controls.
- [`nemotron-switchyard/`](./nemotron-switchyard/) — Co-locate Nemotron and Qwen on DGX Spark and route requests with NVIDIA NeMo Switchyard.

Additional samples will be added over time.

## Usage

Each sample directory contains its own README with detailed deployment and usage instructions. In general:

1. Provision the required OCI infrastructure (cluster, compute, networking, storage) as described in the sample.
2. Deploy the NVIDIA software components.
3. Run the included workloads or applications.
4. Clean up the resources when you are done to avoid unnecessary charges.
